## How to use

You can use it through npm (the preferred way) or download a bundle from our
github release page.

### With npm

In your project:

```bash
npm install --save veinsjs
```

This package contains the TypsScript-compatible sources of Veins.

if you use TypeScript, you can directly write

```typescript
import * as Veins from 'veinsjs'
```

else if you use Javascript, you can write

```typescript
import 'veinsjs/dist/veins.min.js'
```

Alternatively, we provide a bundle you can directly include in your html files
that exposes `Veins` in `window`:

```html
<script src="node_modules/veinsjs/dist/veins.min.js"></script>
```
